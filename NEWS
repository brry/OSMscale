Feedback, ideas, code suggestions welcome at berry-b@gmx.de or via github.com/brry/OSMscale
Before the actual NEWS, here are some things planned for future development:
-----------------------------
- example for point transformation from utm to mercator



-----------------------------
-----------------------------

Version 0.2.1 (2016-07-27)
second stable release
- suppress warning from openmap
- scalebar type="bar" added
- argument rearranged and names changed sometimes
- now prints progress messages


-----------------------------
-----------------------------

Version 0.1.7 (2016-06-21)
first stable release with 3 functions: pointsMap, projectPoints, scaleBar
Can download openstreetmap background map for a data.frame with points,
project those (and the map itself) to UTM (or any other projection),
draws accurate scalebars even in the default OSM mercator projection (currently minimalistic in design)
