- API unified to function(lat, long, data, ...)
- scaleBar: automatic abslen and ndiv selection greatly improved
- tracing of errors is simplified through berryFunctions::traceCall()
- pointsMap can now handle a single coordinate location
- projectPoints can now return the spTransform output
- documentation and a few defaults have been improved

first release on CRAN
Detailed changes at https://github.com/brry/OSMscale/commits/master
- documentation (examples + github readme) expanded + improved
- scaleBar automatic length selection improved and abslen unit bug corected
- projectPoints can now handle datasets with NAs
- pointsMap: argument scale can now be a list of arguments

- new functions: degree, earthDist, checkLL
- new projection functions: putm, posm, pll
- moved here from berryFunctions: equidistPoints, randomPoints, triangleArea

-----------------------------
-----------------------------

Version 0.2.1 (2016-07-27)
second stable release
- suppress warning from openmap
- scalebar type="bar" added
- argument rearranged and names changed sometimes
- now prints progress messages

-----------------------------
-----------------------------

Version 0.1.7 (2016-06-21)
first stable release with 3 functions: pointsMap, projectPoints, scaleBar
Can download openstreetmap background map for a data.frame with points,
project those (and the map itself) to UTM (or any other projection),
draws accurate scalebars even in the default OSM mercator projection (currently minimalistic in design)
