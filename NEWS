  implicit list embedding of S4 objects is deprecated
- more scalebar types

Version 0.-.- (2016--)


-----------------------------
-----------------------------

Version 0.1.7 (2016-06-21)
first stable release with 3 functions: pointsMap, projectPoints, scaleBar
Can download openstreetmap backgrund map for a data.frame with points, 
project those (and the map itself) to UTM (or any other projection),
draws accurate scalebars even in the default OSM mercator projection (currently minimalistic in design)
